We already have the 6 rows with 5 blocks each. Now, when we click on a block, a settings dialog will open and we can edit the color, the lesson name, the class name and the school name. In the next step, if we click on a block, another page should be open (or a popup dialog) with a settings button on the top right corner, which will open the current settings dialog with the color, lesson name and so on. Inside the new page, we need two lists with text line items and text line subitems wich can be filled by the user (default is an empty list), items can be collapsed and expand again. There must be a button to add an item and a button to add an subitem to an selected item. The list on the right side is loaded from and saved to a jason file, the filename is the lesson name of the block combines with ".json". The left side list is loaded from and saved to a json file with filename combined by the lesson name and the school name of the block added with ".json". The path of all the files can be set inside the main hamburger menu and should be stored inside the prefs. The text line items in the left side list needs a status button and a status text on the left side of each text line with the states "Planned", "Working" and "Finished". The belonging status texts are "P", "W" and "F". Default is "Planned" and each click on the status button will switch the status text to the next status and back to "Planned". One more global button is needed to copy a text line item selected in the right side list into the left side list, above the left lists selected position or at the end of the list if no item is selected on the left side. Also there must be a button to copy a sub item from the right side list into a selected item on the left side list. Also the items and subitems on the left side list may be moved one row to the top, or one row to the button of the list. The subitems stay inside the item, if the item is moved. The sub items may be moved inside the parent item only.
