## **The Timetable App - Teachers_Timetable:**  
  
### **Overview & First Steps**  
The Teachers Timetable project offers a simple and user-friendly way to manage and organize the schedules of teachers. It allows teachers to track the tasks for each class. But of course this is not only for teachers...  

- **Short Description:**  
With this app, you can create and print your timetable, task lists, and notes on Windows and Android. Currently, the timetable consists of a table of 5 days × 6 blocks (hours). Clicking on one of the blocks takes you to the detailed view with configuration options.  
  
- **Multilingualism:**
German and English  
  
- **Supported Platforms:**  
Android and Windows  
  
- **Required Permissions:**  
The app only saves its settings to its own document directory and does not require any other permissions. If the user selects Export or Import from the main menu, files must be saved, shared, and read outside the app to save and synchronize the settings.  
  
- **Quick Start Guide for Windows:**  
Copy the ZIP file to a new directory of your choice (e.g., C:\Tools\Timetable) and extract it, for example, using File Explorer. Right-click on the file "teachers_timetable.exe" and select "Pin to Start" so you can easily access it from the Start menu. For updates, simply extract the new ZIP file back into this directory and overwrite the old files.  
  
- **Quick Start Guide for Android:**  
As long as the app is not yet visible in the Google Play Store, save the APK file to your Android tablet or phone and install it using a file manager that has permission (e.g., Google's "Files" app or your browser).  
  
## **App Features**

Clicking on a block takes you to the block's detail view.  
If the block has never been edited, you will be taken directly to the settings for its color and text. These settings can also be changed later at any time via the menu in the detail view.  
In this detail view, depending on the settings, you will first see the work schedule with the lists, or the notes for this block.  
  
  
### **Details Page - The Block View**  
  
Here in the work plan, you'll find a list (the task list) for planned, currently in-progress, or already completed tasks and the task steps, with corresponding status management (**P**lanning, **W**orking, **F**inished). There's also another, similarly structured list (the suggestion list), which, once created, can remain unchanged for years as a pool of possible task. Tasks and task steps can be transferred from the suggestion list to the task list at any time.  
  
Furthermore, notes for the block can be displayed here via a menu item. The order in which the work plan and notes are displayed can be set in the menu.  
  
**Settings in the Details Menu:**  
  
> The task list (left side) can be hidden/shown  
> The suggestion list (right side) can be hidden/shown  
> The task list can be printed or saved as a PDF  
> Notes can be opened (when tasks are currently displayed)  
> Tasks can be opened (when notes are currently displayed)  
> The file names and display order for the lists and notes can be changed  
> The text and the color of the block on the main page can be set  
  
All options in this view are described below.  
  
### **Detailed User Manual**  
  
- **Timetable Management / Export/Import**  
The export/import function allows you to create a complete backup of your data and settings at any time. This should be done regularly after making changes. The resulting ZIP file, containing the date, can be saved by the user and imported again at any time. This allows you to manage the school years, try out different colors and settings, and so on. Furthermore, data can be easily exchanged between the Windows and Android apps. Major changes at the start of the school year can thus be more easily implemented in the Windows version, and the results can then be used in the Android app. The app data is identical, but may change from version to version. The same version should always be used on all devices.
The version can be found at the top of the home screen menu.  
During import, only the files contained in the ZIP file are imported to the device, overwriting the existing files. No other files are deleted. If the ZIP file contains fewer files than the importing device, these files will be retained on the device. Advanced users can exploit this by modifying the ZIP file, but at their own risk. To delete all files (restore to factory settings), you can do so via the Android built-in "App Info" and "Clear Storage," or using Windows File Explorer in the "Documents" folder under "Timetable." Of course, close the app beforehand.  
  
- **Work Plan / Manage Tasks/Steps**  
The work plan was originally added to the app to allow a crafts teacher to plan her projects with the necessary steps and save the status of each step for the specific class. Essentially, it's a weekly schedule. The lists can, of course, also be used for other purposes. Because the filenames used to store and reload entries in the lists can be freely chosen, there are no limits to what can be entered in these files or lists. For example, there could be a task list for each lesson block (the default setting, as the filename consists of the abbreviation for the lesson name, class name, and school), or one for each day of the week, If all blocks one monday have the same filename (e.g., "Monday"), or one for each unit across all schools (e.g., the lesson name only). The latter is also the default setting for the suggestion lists, as the tasks are likely dependent only on the grade level and lesson. Of course, by repeatedly changing the filename of the suggestion list, any tasks from multiple lists can be added to the task list on the left side, and so on.  

- **Additional buttons in the work plan view**  
The "+ Task" button adds a task to the list, which can then be moved using the up/down arrow buttons. With a doubleclick on the line the text can be editited.
If a task is selected, another step can be added below the selected task using the "+ Step" button and moved using the corresponding up/down arrow buttons. The text can be edited after a doubleclick on the line.
The two buttons "<= Task" and "<= Step" allow you to copy entire tasks or individual work steps from the right-hand list to the left-hand list. To do this, a task or work step must be selected on the right, and in the case of a work step, a task must also be selected on the left to insert the step.  
The red minus sign in a circle deletes an entire task or a task step from a list.  
All changes are saved automatically and cannot be undone.  
    
- **Using Status Management in the Task List**  
The task list features a colored status indicator and a letter, at the beginning of the task step line, to represent the current status of the step. Currently, the colored circles are yellow with a "(P)" for "Planned," yellow with a "(W)" for "Working," and green with a "(F)" for "Finished." Clicking the colored circle changes the status in the sequence P, W, F, and back to P. This makes it easy to see which steps have already been completed and which are still pending for each task. Once all steps for a task are complete, the task is displayed collapsed when the window is opened, improving clarity.
